It all began 1119 years ago, Jake Parrot hid his loot mostly gold at some place before getting arrested. 
As the treasure was not recovered rumours spread and people claimed to have seen Jake digging at multiple locations around the globe. 
Many young pirates vistied Jakes's wife to ask if she knows about the treasure location and she told them all she knew. 
Start at the great barrier reef he told to her before he was caught. 
She dispised his ways and said the money was cursed and all in pursuit have failed and have not returned. 
Do you wish to find the burried treasure? Is the adventure worth risking your life??
