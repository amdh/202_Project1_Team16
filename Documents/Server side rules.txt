client hits the server everytime to see if any player has reached stage 7. 
if so, it will pull all that data (player_id) and compare with the current machine if the player_id matches.
If not, display loser, else display winner

On every stage clear, the client will hit the server and update the stage on server side.

server will store client id and stage. (like a hashmap)

lives lost will be managed on the client side. When the last life is lost, it will hit the server and update the stage to '-1'.

player_id     Stage
    1           4
    2           7
    3          -1
    
   so player 3 is dead, player 2 has reached the final stage, and will display winner on his sreen n looser on the others..
